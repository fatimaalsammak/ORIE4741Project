# ORIE 4741 Project: Election Turnout Predictive Model for Presidential Elections

Team: Fatima Al-Sammak (fma29) and Alexander Ellis (ase49)

We intend to use our machine learning algorithm to predict the voter turnout of a future presidential election. We will do so by looking at the turnout of America’s presidential primaries, its GDP, and its GINI coefficient over a number of years. We see primary turnout as representative of overall political interest for a given year. We also see the state of the economy, as well as the level of income inequality, as critical factors in somebody’s willingness to get out and vote. We will also consider the incumbency status of presidential candidates, which can impact the level of excitement the electorate feels about participating in the electoral process. Together, we hope to provide our media stakeholders with information that will add detail to their existing predictive models.
